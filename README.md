# KathySong

# KathySong is a Python-based song identification game in which players compete to identify songs from as little audio as possible.
# The game allows the user to set up a game, selecting samples from music files on the user's own computer,
# and to play through these samples competitively.

# KathySong is a windowed application using Tkinter and uses Pydub and Simpleaudio for audio manipulation and play.
